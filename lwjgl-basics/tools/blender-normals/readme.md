Renders the scene as a tangent-space normal map pass.

#Set Up

- If you're using a different coordinate system, adjust the colors and positions of your hemi lights as necessary.
- Use the "WhiteNormalMaterial" on your objects to ensure proper illumination.
- Ensure your objects are centered correctly, for e.g. xyz=(0, 0, 0).
- Use ortho projection (`Numpad 5`) and front (`Numpad 1`), then `Ctrl + Alt + Numpad 0` to set the camera to that view.
- In order to render correctly, the template uses `None` as the Display Device and `Raw` for Color Space (in `Scene > Color Management`).
